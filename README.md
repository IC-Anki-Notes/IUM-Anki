# IUM Anki Flashcard Deck

An Anki flashcard deck for **Introduction to University Mathematics (MATH40001/40009)** at **Imperial College London**.

This deck is designed to reinforce core concepts through active recall and spaced repetition, supporting students in developing fluency with formal mathematical language and reasoning.

## üß† Coverage

The deck is organized into three major sections:

### Logic & Sets
- **Propositions & Logic**: Logical connectives, truth tables, quantifiers, implications, equivalence.
- **Sets**: Set notation, operations, Cartesian products, power sets.
- **Functions**: Domain, codomain, injectivity, surjectivity, bijectivity, composition, inverses.
- **Binary Relations**: Reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, equivalence relations, partial orders.

### Numbers
- **Natural Numbers & Peano Axioms**: Inductive definitions, recursion, mathematical induction.
- **Integers & Rational Numbers**: Construction via equivalence classes, ordering, arithmetic.
- **Real Numbers**: Completeness, density, supremum/infimum, decimal expansions.

### Applied
- Selected applications of logic, set theory, and number systems in proof writing and problem solving.
- Emphasis on abstraction, formal structure, and mathematical rigor.

## üì¶ Features

- **Imperial-Specific**: Aligned with lecture content and notation conventions used in MATH40001/40009.
- **LaTeX Support**: Mathematical expressions are rendered cleanly for clarity.
- **Structured Tags**: Cards are tagged by topic and subtopic for easy filtering.
- **Editable**: Cards can be customized to suit individual learning styles.
